# EU Withdrawal Button for Zen Cart

From 19 June 2026, online stores selling to consumers in the EU must let a customer withdraw from a purchase as easily as they made it, with a **withdrawal button** on the website (Article 11a of the EU Consumer Rights Directive, added by Directive (EU) 2023/2673). This plugin adds it to Zen Cart.

Runs on Zen Cart 1.5.8 through 3.0.0 and PHP 7.4 through 8.5 from one codebase, as an encapsulated plugin: no core or template files are changed.

## What's in it

- A **Withdraw From Contract Here** button in the footer of every page, placed by Zen Cart's own footer hooks.
- The withdrawal page: name, order and email, then a review screen with the **Confirm Withdrawal** button. No account needed; a logged-in customer picks from their recent orders, already filled in.
- An emailed **acknowledgment of receipt** with the statement and the date and time it was submitted, in the Store Time Zone. A notice to the store with every statement.
- Never refuses a withdrawal: a statement that doesn't match an order is saved for the store to check, and the spam trap holds a statement for staff instead of dropping it (and without emailing the address given).
- A matched order gets a history note hidden from the customer, and optionally a new status.
- Customers > Withdrawals: every statement, its status (Held, Received, In Progress, Done), a staff note, and Send Acknowledgment.
- The two labels the law fixes, in the directive's own words, for English, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
- Show Withdrawal Button To: all visitors, or only visitors in chosen countries (EU and EEA by default), by order, account or Cloudflare country.
- Preview Email definitions for both emails.

It gives a store the function Article 11a describes. It doesn't decide whether a withdrawal is valid, and it isn't legal advice.

**EU Withdrawal Button Pro** (planned, sold separately) will turn withdrawals into a returns portal: item-level returns, RMA numbers, return labels and status emails.
